<h1>Handlebar</h1>
Handlebar (Handle for short) is the Package Manager for Baton

It uses the PyPI API to download files (Specifically, A Package's Source).
It relies on "winhttpjs.bat" to make HTTP Requests.
(https://github.com/npocmaka/batch.scripts/blob/master/hybrids/jscript/winhttpjs.bat)
It gets the tar.gz file and decompresses it, placing it in the "Installed" Folder.

How to Use:
1. Download Baton with Handle
2. Add baton.bat and handle.bat to the PATH
3. Run the commands from the Command Line
